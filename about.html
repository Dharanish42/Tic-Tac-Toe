            <ol>
                <li>The game is played on a 3x3 grid.</li>
                <li>Player 1 is <b>X</b> and Player 2 is <b>O</b>. Players take turns placing their marks in empty squares.</li>
                <li>The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.</li>
                <li>If all 9 squares are filled and neither player has 3 in a row, the game ends in a draw.</li>
